	<h2 style="color:white;"><u>History</u></h2>
	<p style="color:white;">Nashik was known by many names. It was known as "Padmanagar" during the Satya Yuga, "Trikantak" during the Treta Yuga, "Janasthana" during the Dvapara Yuga, and finally "Navashikh" or "Nashik" during the Kali Yuga, according to Hindu traditions. Nashik is significant in mythology, history, social life, and culture. The city is located on the banks of the Godavari River, making it a sacred site for Hindus around the world. During his 14-year exile from Ayodhya, Rama, the king of Ayodhya, is said to have made Nashik his home</p>
	<p style="color:white;">Nasik Tram was started from Old Municipal Building on the main road to Nasik Road railway station around 1889. The tram served the people of Nasik for almost 44 years. The tram station was at the Main Road, and the tram reached the Nashik Road railway station via present Main Road, Bhadrakali Market, Ghasbazar, and Phalke road. It covered a distance of about eight to ten km, and the stretch used to be covered with dense jungle at the time. In the article ‘Nashik-then’, poet Kusumagraj has written passionately about trams. He writes, "If the carriages were full, the tram would leave. It would ring the bell and drive out of the village to the main road and then to the grass market.</p>

<p style="color: white;">The Trirashmi (Pandavleni) Caves, or Nashik Caves, are a group of 24 caves carved between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE, representing the Hinayana Buddhist caves.</p>
<h3 style="color: white;"><mark>Kumbh Mela:</mark></h3>
<p style="color: white;">The Kumbh Mela is celebrated every six years at Haridwar and Prayagraj and Maha Kumbh takes place every twelve years at four places: Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik. According to the Puranas, it is believed that Kumbh derives its name from an immortal pot of nectar, which the devatas (Gods) and rakshasas (Demons) fought over. The four places where the nectar fell are at the banks of river Godavari in Nashik, river Kshipra in Ujjain, river Ganges in Haridwar and at Triveni Sangam of Ganga, Yamuna and invisible Saraswati River in Prayagraj.</p>
